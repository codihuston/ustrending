          # Change this path if you want to mount the db elsewhere in Windows!

          #   mount # path.
          #   - The `/mnt/host` token is defined in `wsl.conf` in Windows wsl
          #   (and is the default value). If you have multiple developers on
          #   one machine, change this path to keep separate instances!

          #   drop the two aforementioned tokens from the path
          #   - IMPORTANT: This will keep your db persistent across reboots,
          #   ***even when running `skaffold delete`***!
